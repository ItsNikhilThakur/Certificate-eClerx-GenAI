AI is here to stay—and I’m excited to say I’m ready for it.
Just completed my certification in Generative AI from the Technical University of Munich through the Skill of the Year 2025 program by eClerx.This course gave me a strong foundation in how large language models work, how prompts drive outputs, and how businesses can responsibly integrate GenAI into their processes.
As someone from a non-technical background, I found the sessions accessible, hands-on, and incredibly insightful.
Special thanks to Dr. Stephan Krusche for being an outstanding guide. #eClerx #SkillOfTheYear #LearningAtEclerx
